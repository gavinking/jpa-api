* SecondaryTable
* SqlResultSetMapping
* SequenceGenerator
* TableGenerator

Added SequenceGenerators and TableGenerators annotations.

AttributeConverter classes.

Added support for the mapping of the following java.time types:

* java.time.LocalTime
* java.time.LocalDateTime
* java.time.OffsetTime
* java.time.OffsetDateTime

Added default Stream getResultStream() method
to Query interface.

Added default Stream<X> getResultStream()
method to TypedQuery interface.

Replaced reference to JAR file specification
in persistence provider bootstrapping section with more general
reference to Java SE service provider requirements.

Updated persistence.xml and orm.xml schemas to 2.2 versions.

Updated Related Documents.

=== Jakarta Persistence 3.0

Created document from Java Persistence 2.2 Final Release specification.

The document was converted to _Asciidoc_ format.

Packages of all API classes were changed to _jakarta.persistence_. These changes are reflected in the specification document.

Schema namespaces were changed from http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/persistence and http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/persistence/orm
to https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence and https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence/orm

References to schema versions lower than 2.2 were removed.

=== Jakarta Persistence 3.1

`EntityManagerFactory` and `EntityManager` interfaces extend `java.lang.AutoCloseable` interface

Fixed `ClassTransformer.transform` to throw Persistence API specific exception

Added support for `java.util.UUID` and `GenerationType.UUID`

Added _CEILING_, _EXP_, _FLOOR_, _LN_, _POWER_, _ROUND_, and _SIGN_
numeric functions to Jakarta Persistence QL and _ceiling()_, _exp()_,
_floor(), _ln()_, _power()_,  _round()_, and _sign()_ to Criteria API

Added _LOCAL DATE_, _LOCAL DATETIME_, and _LOCAL TIME_ functions to Jakarta Persistence QL and
corresponding _localDate()_, _localDateTime()_, and _localTime()_ to Criteria API

Added _EXTRACT_ function to Jakarta Persistence QL

Added support for __Expression__s as conditions in _Criteria_ `CASE` expressions

Clarified mixing types of query input parameters

Added missing definition of _single_valued_embeddable_object_field_ in Jakarta Persistence QL BNF

Clarified definition of the _Basic_ type

Clarified the order of parameters in the _LOCATE_ function

Clarified `SqlResultSetMapping` with multiple ``EntityResult``s and conflicting aliases

=== Jakarta Persistence 3.2

Added support for Java record types as embeddable classes

Added support for _java.time.Instant_ and _java.time.Year_ and clarified JDBC mappings for basic types

Added `||` string concatenation operator

Added support for specifying null precedence when ordering JPQL and criteria queries

Added _getSingleResultOrNull()_ to _Query_, _TypedQuery_, _StoredProcedureQuery_

Overload _concat()_ to accept list of expressions in _CriteriaBuilder_

Overload _where()_, _having()_, _and()_, and _or()_ to accept _List<Predicate>_ in _CriteriaQuery_ and _CriteriaBuilder_

Added _equalTo()_ and _notEqualTo()_ to _Expression_

Added _concat()_ overload accepting list of expressions to _CriteriaBuilder_

Made the _name_ member of _TableGenerator_ and _SequenceGenerator_ optional

Introduced _comment_ and _check_ members to table and column annotations, along with _CheckConstraint_

Clarified the primary key types supported for each _GenerationType_

Entity and embeddable classes may now be static inner classes

Primary key classes are no longer required to be public and serializable

Pulled _getParameters()_ up from _CriteriaQuery_ to _CommonAbstractCriteria_
